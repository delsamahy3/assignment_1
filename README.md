## Structure
    Dataset 1 : Breast Cancer Wisconsin http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

    Dataset 2: Car Evaluation http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation

    For each dataset, there is an independant data preprocessing script, as well as scripts for all 5 algorithms:
        1. SVM
        2. KNN
        3. Decision Trees
        4. Boosting
        5. Neural Network

## Available scripts per dataset

```
Code is tested using Python 3.8

python boosting_clf.py
python dt_clf.py
python knn_clf.py
python nn_clf.py
python svm_clf.py
```

## Output
Learning curves and text file containing accuracies and logs are available for each algorithm per dataset
